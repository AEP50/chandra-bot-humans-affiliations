Open Databases of Canonical Humans and Affiliations used to support Project Chandra Bot

## Purpose
One challenge in assembling the data that powers [Project Chandra Bot](https://github.com/adb40/project-chandra-bot) is that there is no canonical database of the `humans` that write and review papers. For example, during the course of his career, David Ory (sometimes David T. Ory or D. T. Ory) has been affiliated with Parsons Brinckerhoff (often referred to as PB), the University of California Davis (often referred to as UC Davis), the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (sometimes referred to as MTC), Sidewalk Labs, and WSP (which acquired Parsons Brickerhoff and, immediately following the acquisition, was briefly called WSP|PB). In  order to connect the humans in our community across the papers they author and reviews they write, we need a database that connects canonical names and affiliations with aliases. To do this, we have created an [open Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vEsMP3v9HGSc_Ftfu_pgQRjSQu9GVhfjqRNFpK5u9FI/edit#gid=1579578095) with our first pass at this information. It can be edited by anyone, including you. 

Please raise an [`issue`](https://github.com/adb40/project-chandra-bot-humans-affiliations/issues) in this repository or send [David Ory](david.ory@gmail.com) an email if you would like your name removed from this spreadsheet.
